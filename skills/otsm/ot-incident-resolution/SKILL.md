# OT Incident Resolution

## Overview

This skill provides a structured approach to generating resolution notes for Operational Technology (OT) incidents in ServiceNow. OT incidents require specialized handling due to the safety-critical nature of industrial control systems (ICS), SCADA systems, and operational technology environments where cyber-physical consequences can impact human safety and critical infrastructure.

Key capabilities:
- Document incident containment actions taken for OT/ICS environments
- Capture safety impact assessments and physical consequence analysis
- Record remediation steps with safety validation checkpoints
- Track affected OT devices, zones, and network segments
- Generate resolution notes that satisfy regulatory and audit requirements
- Ensure operational safety protocols are documented throughout the resolution lifecycle

**When to use:** When resolving OT security incidents, ICS anomalies, SCADA system alerts, or any incident affecting operational technology environments where safety and operational continuity are paramount.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `sn_ot_admin`, `sn_ot_analyst`, `sn_si_analyst`, or `itil` with OT scope access
- **Access:** Read/write access to `sn_ot_incident`, `sn_ot_vulnerability`, `cmdb_ci_ot_device`, and `sys_journal_field` tables
- **Plugins:** Operational Technology (com.snc.ot) and Security Incident Response (com.snc.si) must be active
- **Knowledge:** Understanding of ICS/SCADA systems, Purdue Model network segmentation, and industrial safety protocols

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve OT Incident Details

Fetch the OT incident record with all classification and impact fields.

**Using MCP:**
```

Parameters:
  table_name: sn_ot_incident
  sys_id: [INCIDENT_SYS_ID]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,severity,category,subcategory,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,resolved_at,affected_ci,cmdb_ci,location,impact,urgency,business_impact,safety_impact,ot_zone,attack_vector,containment_status,resolution_code,resolution_notes,close_notes
```

If searching by number:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_ot_incident
  query: number=OT0012345
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,severity,category,subcategory,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,affected_ci,cmdb_ci,location,impact,safety_impact,ot_zone,attack_vector,containment_status

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-NL-Search` | Natural language search (e.g., "find critical OT incidents in Zone 3") |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Structured queries for incidents, devices, vulnerabilities, and work notes |
| `SN-Read-Record` | Retrieve specific incident or device records by sys_id |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/sn_ot_incident` | GET | OT incident records |
| `/api/now/table/cmdb_ci_ot_device` | GET | OT device inventory |
| `/api/now/table/sn_ot_vulnerability` | GET | OT vulnerability records |
| `/api/now/table/sn_si_incident` | GET | Security incident correlation |
| `/api/now/table/sys_journal_field` | GET | Work notes and activity |
| `/api/now/table/change_request` | GET | Related change requests |

## Best Practices

- **Safety first:** Always document safety impact assessment before technical remediation details
- **Never patch without change control:** OT environments require formal change management even for security patches
- **Preserve forensic evidence:** Document device states and network captures before containment actions alter evidence
- **Coordinate with operations:** OT incident response must involve plant/operations personnel, not just IT security
- **Respect Purdue Model boundaries:** Document which network zones were affected and ensure containment respects zone segmentation
- **Verify safety systems:** After remediation, explicitly verify that Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) and Emergency Shutdown (ESD) systems are fully operational
- **Document regulatory requirements:** Note any mandatory reporting obligations (NERC CIP, IEC 62443, NIST SP 800-82)
- **Include physical verification:** Resolution of OT incidents often requires physical on-site verification, not just remote confirmation

## Troubleshooting

### "OT incident table not available"

**Cause:** The Operational Technology plugin is not installed or activated.
**Solution:** Verify that `com.snc.ot` plugin is active. Check if the OT module is licensed for your instance. The table may be `sn_ot_incident` or a custom extension.

### "Device records missing OT-specific fields"

**Cause:** OT devices may be stored in base CMDB classes without OT extensions.
**Solution:** Check `cmdb_ci_ot_device` and its child classes (`cmdb_ci_ot_plc`, `cmdb_ci_ot_rtu`, `cmdb_ci_ot_hmi`). Some organizations use custom classes for OT equipment.

### "Cannot find related vulnerabilities"

**Cause:** OT vulnerability data may not be synced or the affected_ci reference may use a different field.
**Solution:** Try querying `sn_ot_vulnerability` by device name or IP address instead of sys_id. Check if vulnerability data is imported from a third-party OT security tool.

### "Safety impact fields are empty"

**Cause:** Custom safety assessment fields may not be populated, or the organization uses a separate safety management system.
**Solution:** Check work notes for safety-related entries. Review any linked records in risk or safety management tables. Consult the safety officer for manual assessment documentation.

```

### Example 2: SCADA Network Anomaly Resolution

**Scenario:** Anomalous network traffic detected on SCADA communication channels.

```
OT INCIDENT OT0004533 - RESOLVED
Anomalous Modbus Traffic on SCADA Network
Severity: Critical | Safety Impact: Low (monitoring only)
Duration: 12 hours

AFFECTED: 3 RTUs in Zone 1 (Water Treatment Facility)
Root Cause: Misconfigured network monitoring tool generating
excessive Modbus polling requests

CONTAINMENT: Disabled monitoring tool polling, verified RTU
operation unaffected.

REMEDIATION: Reconfigured monitoring tool with correct polling
intervals. Added Modbus traffic rate limiting at Zone 1 firewall.

LESSONS LEARNED: Network monitoring tools in OT environments
must be validated against OT protocol specifications before
deployment to prevent false positives and operational disruption.
