# OT Incident Summarization

## Overview

This skill generates comprehensive summaries of Operational Technology (OT) incidents in ServiceNow, tailored for OT security analysts, plant managers, and safety officers. OT incident summaries differ from IT incident summaries because they must address physical safety implications, affected industrial processes, device inventory across OT zones, and regulatory reporting requirements.

Key capabilities:
- Consolidate OT incident details with safety impact classification
- Inventory all affected OT devices with zone mapping and criticality ratings
- Assess containment status and isolation effectiveness
- Track operational continuity impact on industrial processes
- Summarize vulnerability context for exploited weaknesses
- Produce summaries suitable for regulatory reporting and management briefing

**When to use:** When an OT security analyst needs to brief management on an active or recent OT incident, when a safety officer requires incident context for safety review, when preparing shift handover documentation for OT security operations, or when generating regulatory compliance reports.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `sn_ot_admin`, `sn_ot_analyst`, `sn_si_analyst`, or equivalent OT security role
- **Access:** Read access to `sn_ot_incident`, `sn_ot_vulnerability`, `cmdb_ci_ot_device`, `sys_journal_field`, and `task_sla` tables
- **Plugins:** Operational Technology (com.snc.ot) must be active
- **Knowledge:** Familiarity with OT/ICS environments, Purdue Model architecture, and industrial safety concepts

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve OT Incident Record

Fetch the primary incident record with safety and operational fields.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Read-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_ot_incident
  sys_id: [INCIDENT_SYS_ID]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,severity,category,subcategory,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,opened_by,resolved_at,closed_at,impact,urgency,safety_impact,business_impact,ot_zone,attack_vector,containment_status,affected_ci,cmdb_ci,location,resolution_code,resolution_notes,escalation,correlation_id
```

If searching by number:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_ot_incident
  query: number=OT0012345

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-NL-Search` | Natural language searches (e.g., "show critical OT incidents this week") |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Structured queries for incidents, devices, vulnerabilities |
| `SN-Read-Record` | Retrieve specific records by sys_id |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/sn_ot_incident` | GET | OT incident records |
| `/api/now/table/cmdb_ci_ot_device` | GET | OT device inventory |
| `/api/now/table/sn_ot_vulnerability` | GET | OT vulnerability data |
| `/api/now/table/sys_journal_field` | GET | Work notes and timeline |
| `/api/now/table/task_sla` | GET | SLA compliance status |

## Best Practices

- **Lead with safety:** Always present safety impact assessment before technical details in OT summaries
- **Map to Purdue levels:** Reference the Purdue Model level for affected zones to help stakeholders understand network position
- **Distinguish IT vs OT impact:** Clearly separate IT network impacts from OT process impacts
- **Include device firmware versions:** Firmware versions are critical for OT vulnerability assessment and remediation planning
- **Note protocol specifics:** Industrial protocols (Modbus, DNP3, OPC UA, EtherNet/IP) affect containment and remediation approaches
- **Track safety system status:** Always report the status of Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS), Emergency Shutdown (ESD), and fire suppression systems
- **Document physical verification:** Note when conclusions are based on remote monitoring vs. physical on-site verification
- **Flag regulatory obligations:** Identify applicable regulatory frameworks and any mandatory reporting deadlines

## Troubleshooting

### "OT incident records return empty results"

**Cause:** The OT incident table may use a different name or be a custom extension.
**Solution:** Check for `sn_ot_incident`, `sn_si_incident` (Security Incident), or custom tables. Some organizations track OT incidents within standard `incident` table with a category filter.

### "Device zone information is missing"

**Cause:** OT zone classification may not be populated in the CMDB.
**Solution:** Check the `ot_zone` or `network_zone` field. Some implementations use custom fields or location-based zone mapping. Consult the OT CMDB administrator.

### "Safety impact field not available"

**Cause:** The safety_impact field may be a custom addition not present in the base OT plugin.
**Solution:** Check for custom fields like `u_safety_impact`, `u_safety_classification`, or similar. Review work notes for safety-related assessments documented manually.

### "Related incidents query returns too many results"

**Cause:** Broad zone queries may match a large number of incidents.
**Solution:** Narrow the date range, add severity filters, or filter by specific category/subcategory to find the most relevant related incidents.
