# Government Case Summarization

## Overview

This skill generates comprehensive summaries of government and public sector cases in ServiceNow Public Sector Digital Services (PSDS). It addresses the unique requirements of government case management including regulatory compliance tracking, service eligibility determination, inter-agency coordination, privacy considerations, and audit trail documentation.

Key capabilities:
- Retrieve and consolidate case details with citizen/constituent context
- Track service eligibility determinations and benefit program status
- Summarize inter-agency coordination and referral chains
- Document regulatory compliance status and applicable mandates
- Build audit-ready case timelines with full provenance tracking
- Produce summaries that respect PII handling requirements and data classification

**When to use:** When a caseworker needs a quick overview of a citizen case for shift handover, when a supervisor reviews case backlogs, when preparing for audit or compliance review, or when coordinating case transfers between agencies or departments.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `sn_psds_caseworker`, `sn_psds_supervisor`, `sn_psds_admin`, or equivalent public sector role
- **Access:** Read access to `sn_psds_case`, `sn_psds_service`, `interaction`, `sys_journal_field`, `sn_psds_task`, and `sn_psds_eligibility` tables
- **Plugins:** Public Sector Digital Services (com.snc.psds) must be active
- **Compliance:** Familiarity with applicable privacy regulations (FOIA, Privacy Act, state-specific requirements)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve Core Case Details

Fetch the primary case record with all citizen, service, and compliance fields.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Read-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_psds_case
  sys_id: [CASE_SYS_ID]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,urgency,impact,category,subcategory,contact,account,opened_at,opened_by,assigned_to,assignment_group,resolved_at,closed_at,resolution_code,resolution_notes,service,program,eligibility_status,agency,department,case_type,due_date,sla_due,escalation,data_classification
```

If searching by case number:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_psds_case
  query: number=PSDS0012345
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,contact,account,opened_at,assigned_to,assignment_group,service,program,eligibility_status,agency,department,case_type,due_date,data_classification

  table_name: customer_contact
  query: sys_id=[CONTACT_SYS_ID]
  fields: sys_id,name,email,phone,title,account,city,state,zip,preferred_language,preferred_contact_method,accessibility_needs
  limit: 1
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/customer_contact/{CONTACT_SYS_ID}?sysparm_fields=sys_id,name,email,phone,account,city,state,zip,preferred_language,preferred_contact_method,accessibility_needs&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Service and Program Details

Get the government service and program information linked to the case.

### Step 4: Check Eligibility Determinations

Retrieve eligibility assessment records and determination history.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table

```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_psds_eligibility?sysparm_query=case=[CASE_SYS_ID]^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=sys_id,service,determination,determination_date,criteria_met,criteria_not_met,reviewed_by,appeal_status,expiration_date,notes&sysparm_limit=10&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 5: Retrieve Case Tasks and Actions

Pull all tasks and action items associated with the case.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_psds_task
  query: parent=[CASE_SYS_ID]^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-NL-Search` | Natural language case search (e.g., "find open benefits cases in Region 5") |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Structured queries for cases, services, eligibility, and interactions |
| `SN-Read-Record` | Retrieve a single case or service record by sys_id |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/sn_psds_case` | GET | Government case records |
| `/api/now/table/sn_psds_service` | GET | Government service catalog |
| `/api/now/table/sn_psds_eligibility` | GET | Eligibility determinations |
| `/api/now/table/sn_psds_task` | GET | Case tasks and actions |
| `/api/now/table/interaction` | GET | Citizen interactions |
| `/api/now/table/sys_journal_field` | GET | Work notes and audit trail |
| `/api/now/table/customer_contact` | GET | Citizen contact details |

## Best Practices

- **Protect PII:** Never include Social Security numbers, full dates of birth, or other sensitive PII in summaries unless the recipient is authorized
- **Note data classification:** Always include the data classification level in the summary header
- **Track regulatory deadlines:** Government cases often have statutory response deadlines; highlight any approaching or missed deadlines
- **Document inter-agency handoffs:** When cases involve multiple agencies, clearly document which agency owns each action item
- **Preserve audit trail:** Government cases require complete audit trails; never summarize away critical decision points or determination rationale
- **Respect language preferences:** Note the citizen's preferred language and any translation services used during interactions
- **Include accessibility context:** Document any accessibility accommodations needed or provided
- **Note appeal rights:** When eligibility determinations are included, always reference the citizen's appeal rights and deadlines

## Troubleshooting

### "PSDS case table not found"

**Cause:** The PSDS plugin may not be installed, or the table name may differ in your instance.
**Solution:** Check for `sn_psds_case` or similar tables. Some government instances use custom case tables extending `sn_customerservice_case` or `task`. Verify the PSDS plugin (com.snc.psds) is active.

### "Eligibility records not linked to case"

**Cause:** Eligibility determinations may use a different reference field or be stored in a separate system.
**Solution:** Try querying `sn_psds_eligibility` by contact or service instead of case. Check if eligibility is tracked in custom fields on the case record itself.

### "Service catalog returns no results"

**Cause:** Government services may be organized differently or use a custom service catalog.
**Solution:** Check `sn_psds_service`, `sc_cat_item`, or custom service tables. Some implementations use the standard service catalog with government-specific categories.

### "Inter-agency tasks not visible"

**Cause:** Tasks assigned to other agencies may be in restricted scopes or have ACL limitations.
**Solution:** Verify your role grants cross-agency visibility. Check if inter-agency tasks use a separate task table or have agency-specific ACLs.
